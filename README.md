# Doing a Shift


## Scheduling

- We use WhenIWork for scheduling (you should already have gotten an email about signing up). You can use this site to set your preferred hours and request time off.
- The schedule for learn experts is sent out every Wednesday for the following week. If you need any days off, book them *before* Wednesday the week before.
- As soon as you get your shifts, check them out and DM Avidor if they're not OK Wednesday night or Thursday morning
- Your shifts may get moved around Wednesday night/Thursday morning to accommodate others, but they should be fixed by noon on Thursday (all times ET)

## Starting a shift

- Go into Flatiron Staff Slack - #learn-experts
- Type `@here: in` to let people know you're on and ready for your shift
- Go to the [Learn Expert Chat](https://learn.co/expert-chat) window. It shows you all questions for the batches that we support. If a question is in expert chat, we support that batch.
- Ask previous shift (if there was one) how things went and to post a list of threads they're in the middle of and want to hand over
- Introduce yourself on those threads and read the thread history so you're up to speed with the issue (let's not make students repeat themselves)
- You'll see there are three categories of questions - requires action, active questions and inactive questions:
  - **Requires Action** is any new question or any question where the student has responded and has been waiting > 15 mins for an expert response. These are top priority and we should keep it fairly empty. **If we see something in requires action, we want to move it out of there as fast as we can.**
  - **Active Questions** is for questions where an expert and a student are actively chatting.
  - **Inactive Questions** are questions where a student hasn't responded to an expert for at least 15 mins so you can ignore them until the student replies when they'll become active questions again.
- Respond to every active question on every thread that isn't being helped by another member of staff. If you can, help them all. If not, let them know you're busy but will try to get back to them as quickly as you can. We get that more than 1-3 lively threads at a time is challenging - just do what you can and enjoy the process!
- An active question is one where the OP (Original Poster) has made a comment that has not yet been responded to by a member of staff.
- If another student is genuinely being helpful to the OP, that's awesome. Encourage them and let everyone know you're there to help if they have problems/issues/questions.

## Slack - Flatiron Staff

learn-experts channel: this is where we can ask questions and chat as a group. Use this channel in lieu of direct messages so we have a good sense of community and we can all learn from one another’s questions and answers.

escalation channel: this is where you can get help from the Labs team to answer questions you are unsure of using `@here` to get everyone's attention. Using this channel gets the dev team's attention and it can distract them from the work they're doing. We'll talk more later about what should go in here and what should not.

## Ending a shift

- Welcome the people taking over your shift (if any) in the #learn-experts Slack channel.
- Post a list of all questions you're in the middle of with an update on each one.
- If there isn't an expert taking over from you, let everyone you're chatting with or have chatted with during the shift that you're going off shift. Let them know that the next person should be on (whenever they should be on).
- Please **fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/forms/d/1lmIrLt4s3WFILxcNunUCXRwSNICfJWxQdTaDtUvizro/viewform)**.  Any time in the last half hour is good - don't stay late to do it, but make sure it gets done!
- Post `@here: out` into the learn-experts slack channel within Flatiron Staff
